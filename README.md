DPâ€‘1 is an open, vendorâ€‘neutral protocol that bundles a digitally signed JSON "playlist" (plus an optional longâ€‘term capsule) so any compliant playerâ€”from museum screens to home framesâ€”can display blockchainâ€‘native, codeâ€‘based art exactly as the artist intended. Like MIDI or RSS in their domains, it supplies a common rail gauge that ends today's patchwork of adâ€‘hoc embed codes, broken CDN links and browserâ€‘specific hacks. Urgency comes from the wave of generative NFTs now aging out of their original runtimes: if we don't lock in a lightweight standard, artworks will keep degrading or disappearing. Feral File is seeding DPâ€‘1â€”hosting the spec, shipping validator tools and using its own FF1 devices as the first reference implementationâ€”while inviting independent nodes to prove interoperability. 

The nearâ€‘term goal is a stable v 1.0 with a public badge program; the longerâ€‘range vision is a durable network where curators publish once and reach every screen. The protocol itself remains free and openâ€‘source so the ecosystem can thrive without locking the rails. 

## Key Features

- **AI-First Design**: Natural language commands for playlist generation and device control
- **Blockchain Security**: Ed25519 signature verification ensures artwork authenticity
- **Platform Neutral**: Works across Node.js, Go, and Rust implementations
- **Flexible Licensing**: Support for open, token-gated, and subscription-based access
- **Capsule Format**: Self-contained `.dp1c` files with artwork and metadata

## Getting Started

### ðŸ“– **Protocol Documentation**
Start with `docs/spec.md` for the complete DP-1 protocol specification and design principles.

### ðŸš€ **Server Implementation**
See `prototype/server/README.md` for detailed setup instructions for the Cloudflare Workers API server, including:
- Local development setup
- KV namespace configuration
- Authentication and secrets management
- Deployment to Cloudflare Workers

### ðŸ”§ **Validator CLI**
See `prototype/validator/README.md` for the Go command-line validator that provides:
- Ed25519 signature verification for DP-1 playlists
- SHA256 asset integrity checking for `.dp1c` capsules  
- Support for URLs and base64 encoded playlist data
- Library usage for Go applications

### ðŸ”§ **API Documentation**
Explore `docs/api/openapi.yaml` for the complete OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification with example requests and responses.

## AI-First Philosophy

DP-1 embraces five core design principles:

- **P1**: Natural language as the primary interface
- **P2**: Context-aware playlist generation
- **P3**: Seamless device coordination
- **P4**: Intelligent content discovery
- **P5**: Adaptive user experience

## License Modes

- **Open**: Public domain artworks, no restrictions
- **Token**: Wallet-based proof of ownership required
- **Subscription**: JWT-based access control
